## 📌 Project Overview  
This project detects and highlights **lane markings** from a static road image using **MATLAB** image processing techniques.  
It is useful for autonomous driving research, road safety analysis, and computer vision experiments.

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🖼 **Processes a static road image** and detects lane boundaries  
- 🎯 **Accurate lane edge detection** using filtering and edge detection algorithms  
- 🖌 **Lane markings highlighted** on the original image  
- ⚡ **Fast and lightweight** — works on single images in seconds  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** MATLAB  
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Grayscale conversion  
  - Noise reduction filters  
  - Edge detection (e.g., Canny)  
  - Region of Interest (ROI) masking  
  - Line detection (Hough Transform)
